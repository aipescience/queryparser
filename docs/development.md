Development notes
=================

Let us first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aipescience/queryparser.git
```

and then create a virtual environment inside of which we can install the
package and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv qpenv
source qpenv /bin/activate
```

After the virtual environment has been activated we can install the package
from the root directory of the package with

```bash
pip install .
```
